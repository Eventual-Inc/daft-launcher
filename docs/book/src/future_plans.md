# Future Plans

The following is a non-exhaustive list of ideas for future improvements to the daft launcher project:

## GCP and Azure support

Daft launcher only currently supports AWS.
We want to extend the launcher to support GCP and Azure as well.

## Improved stories around permissioning

We want to create minimal, stripped-down permission profiles that users can enable and run daft launcher with.
Users can obviously use power permission profiles (i.e., admin profiles) to use with daft launcher, however, this blocks off a lot of users trying this out on cloud profiles that they don't own (i.e., employees working on their company's cloud).
