# Cherries on top
- have the submit API hang and open a stdio connection between the remote and local
  - easy for viewing logs while the process runs in remote
- Add more examples and helpful docs to the README.md
- edit submission to error out if not all workers are alive and pass message to end-user
- edit list such that all cluster nodes are together
  - add some indentation (head is at the top; workers are one line indented; have some "aggregate" stats on workers status)
- understand how public IPs / public DNSs are provisioned upon spin-up
